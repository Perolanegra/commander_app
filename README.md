# commander_app
App built with Ionic 4 using Angular Material

# Goal
App to improve services at bar/restaurants, at each client visit.
After signIn you can look for restaurants, menus and prices, see their locations, and how much is far.

If you are already at the restaurant you can start a visit by scanning the QRCODE present on table, 
wich after that, you will be redirected to your Virtual Command, where you can add/cancel orders.

# Install
So you can run the application by first shooting npm i on console, to update all dependencies, and after that running
the following command to build the apk, so you can install: ionic cordova build android --aot --prod
